UFT(Unified Fuctional Testing):
-------------------------------------

	1: UFT is used for testing the Window Based Applications and Websites, mostly used for testing the Window_Based_Apps.
	
	2: UFT is designed by the HP.
	
	3: UFT uses the VB(Visual Base Script) Language.

	4: UFT is an Advanced_Version of QTP(Quick_Test_Programming).
	
	5: QTP is designed by the Mercury.

Major Differences between the Selenium and UFT are:

		Selenium 							UFT
		----------							-----

	1: Used to test the Websites.					1: Used to test the Websites as well as Window_Based_Applications.
								    (Apps that we install in our Computer are Window_Based_Apps)

	2: Through the WebElements we find the Property values.		2: We Find the Objects By Recording.

	3: Support multiple languages( such as Java,Ruby,C#..,)		3: Supports VB Language.
	
	4: Supports mutliple browsers(Firefox,Chrome,IE ..,)			4: Support Firefox and IE(Internet Explorer).

Checking How the UFT Works:
-------------------------------------

	1: Click on the "Star" Button the Left_Corner of the Tool and Create a "New_GUI_Test".
	
	2: Provide the Project Name and Click on the Record Button and perform the testing that we need to complete and after complete the task "Stop_Record" by clickin on the "Stop_Icon" 	    that on the Pop_Up_Window that we get when we hit on the Record Button.

	3: The Main Advantge is the VB Script will be Completed Automatically by the recording( Which Gets the Objects By Recording).

    When Ashok enter the Username
    And Ashok enter the Password
    Then Ashok should enter the Facebook account
    But Ashok FB HomePageshould not be closed

-------------

package firstCucu.feature;

import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxDriver;

import cucumber.api.java.en.Given;
import cucumber.api.java.en.Then;
import cucumber.api.java.en.When;

public class Final 
{
	WebDriver d;
	@Given("^i am member of Facebook Family$")
	public void i_am_member_of_Facebook_Family() throws Throwable 
	{
	    d=new FirefoxDriver();
	    Thread.sleep(5000);
	    d.get("http://www.facebook.com");
	    Thread.sleep(5000);
	    
	}

	@When("^Ashok enter the Username$")
	public void ashok_enter_the_Username() throws Throwable
	{
		d.findElement(By.id("email")).sendKeys("Bitra9999@gmail.com");
		Thread.sleep(5000);
	}

	@When("^Ashok enter the Password$")
	public void ashok_enter_the_Password() throws Throwable 
	{
		d.findElement(By.id("pass")).sendKeys("********");
		Thread.sleep(5000);
	}

	@Then("^Ashok should enter the Facebook account$")
	public void ashok_should_enter_the_Facebook_account() throws Throwable 
	{
		d.findElement(By.id("loginbutton")).click();
		Thread.sleep(5000);
	}

	@Then("^Ashok FB HomePageshould not be closed$")
	public void ashok_FB_HomePageshould_not_be_closed() throws Throwable 
	{
		d.close();
	}



}
