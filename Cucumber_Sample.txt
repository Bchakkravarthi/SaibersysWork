Cucumber_Sample_Demo:
--------------------------------
	Install these Plugins in Eclipse: (Anyone From Two Links but not Both)
	-------------------------------------

		a: https://cucumber.io/cucumber-eclipse//update-site

 		b: http://cucumber.github.com/cucumber-eclipse/update-site

	1: With the help of Cucumber testing tool we test the logical data steps which we store in "Feature file".
	
	2: Cucumber mainly contains 2 frameworks:

		a: BDD(Behaviour Data Driven): Contains the steps for execution of project.

		b: TDD(Test Data Driven): Contains the Different set of data for execution of project.

	3: As in TestNg, Cucumber Contains the Annotations which have a specific meaning.

	#Sample Feature Definition Template

		1: @tag : Separate different testcases

		2: Feature: Title of your feature
			Example: I want to use this template for my feature file

		@tag1
		3: Scenario: Title of your scenario

		4: Given I want to write a step with precondition
			And some other precondition

		5: When I complete action

		6: And some other action
			And yet another action

		7: Then I validate the outcomes
			And check more outcomes

Sample:
---------

Procedure:
		1: Create a Java Project and Create a package as "Example.feature" .
		2: Always remember to import the Cucumber Jar files with Selenium Jar Files.
		3: Then create a File with "Example.feature" .
		4: Write a sample code to perform the basic functionalities of Cucumber with proper annotations and remember to Give @tag and Once the code is written Select all the code, 		    Right click and set the PrettyFormat.
		5: Select the Example.feature file and Run as Cucumber Feature.
		6: Make sure you delete the "Spring jar file" from the Set of Cucumber jar files.
		7: Copy all the missing snippets data from the Console after running the Step 6 ::: " Create a New Class and Paste all the data from console (Make necesarry Changes) and run 		     the Example.feature file" .
		8: Main Step is Run the Example.feature file.

package firstCucu.feature;

import cucumber.api.java.en.Given;
import cucumber.api.java.en.Then;
import cucumber.api.java.en.When;

public class Final 
{
	@Given("^i am member of Facebook Family$")
	public void i_am_member_of_Facebook_Family() throws Throwable 
	{
	    System.out.println("Ashok is a member of Facebook Family ");
	    
	}

	@When("^Ashok enter the Username$")
	public void ashok_enter_the_Username() throws Throwable
	{
		System.out.println(" Ashok enter the Username ");
	}

	@When("^Ashok enter the Password$")
	public void ashok_enter_the_Password() throws Throwable 
	{
		System.out.println(" Ashok enter the Password "); 
	}

	@Then("^Ashok should enter the Facebook account$")
	public void ashok_should_enter_the_Facebook_account() throws Throwable 
	{
		System.out.println(" Ashok should enter the Facebook account ");   
	}

	@Then("^Ashok FB HomePageshould not be closed$")
	public void ashok_FB_HomePageshould_not_be_closed() throws Throwable 
	{
		System.out.println(" Ashok FB HomePageshould not be closed ");
	}



}
