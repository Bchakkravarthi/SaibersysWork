UFT_Modes:
---------------

There are Generally 4 types of Recording modes in UFT(Unified_Functional_Testing) they are:
	 
	1: Default Recording Mode : These Mode gets the VB_Script by the action of Keyboard and Mouse on the forms.

	2: Analog Recording Mode: These Mode gets the VB_Script by the action of Mouse.

	3: LowLevel Recording Mode: These Recording Mode is the best in termns of Understanding the action that we perform on the form which generally stores the Position_Numbers by 			              clicking.

	4:  Insight Recording Mode: These Mode is used to record the script when ever the Default Recording Mode does not store the objects.

Repositories in UFT:
------------------------

There are generally 2 Types of Repositories in UFT, They are 

	1: Local Object Repository : It is an Default Object Repository where the objects will be shared in the repository whenever we perform the actions on our forms.

	2: Shared or Global  Object Repository : All the Local_Objects will be shared in a "Shared Folder" which can be used by other Projects and these is the phenomenon that works in 				             Shared_Object_Repository.
Procedure:
-------------

Step 1:
--------
	Creating a Shared Object Repository:

		a: All repositories are local by default.  To create a Shared Object Repository, in the Object Repository Dialog Box  , Click File > Export Local Objects .

		b: Repository files have an extension ".tsr" .

		c: The Shared Repository File is now created .

Step 2:
--------
	Associating a Shared Object Repository:

		a: Next step is to associate the repository to your test, which enables you to use it. 

		b: To associate repository with a test, Click Resources > Associate Repository .

		c: You can select the Repository to associate with Actions available in your test.

		d: Now you  can now use this shared repository to develop your test.
